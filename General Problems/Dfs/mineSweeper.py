# Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!

# You are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:

#     'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
#     'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
#     'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
#     digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
#     'X' represents a revealed mine.

# You are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').

# Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

#     If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
#     If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
#     If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
#     Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
