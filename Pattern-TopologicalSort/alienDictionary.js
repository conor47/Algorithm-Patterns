// There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the alphabets. Write a method to find the correct order of the alphabets in the alien language. It is given that the input is a valid dictionary and there exists an ordering among its alphabets.

// Example 1:

// Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
// Output: bac
// Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
// from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:

// 1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
// 2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'

// From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"

// Example 2:

// Input: Words: ["cab", "aaa", "aab"]
// Output: cab
// Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:

// 1. From "cab" and "aaa", we can conclude that 'c' comes before 'a'.
// 2. From "aaa" and "aab", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'b'

// From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "cab"

// Example 3:

// Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
// Output: ywxz
// Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:

// 1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
// 2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
// 3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
// 4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
// 5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'

// From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "ywxz"
